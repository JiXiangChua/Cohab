Instructions how on how to run CoHab mobile application:

First download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
We're not really using Node.js but we need it for npm, which is a package manager that you use to download everything else

Once you've installed that you need to install [expo](https://expo.dev/). Open your terminal or command prompt and run

`npm install -g expo-cli`

Next you need to clone this repo so you have a copy on your computer.
If y'all can't remember how to do the github stuff just try downloading the zip file and unzipping somewhere.
Then cd to wherever you cloned/unzipped and run

`npm install`

After that, run

`npm run start`

It should open a new page in your browser. Remember to keep your terminal open.

After that, download the Expo app on your phone from Google Play or App Store.
Scan the qr code, and it should work.
