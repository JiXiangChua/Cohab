hello friends pls follow my instructions

first download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
we're not really using Node.js but we need it for npm, which is a package manager that you use to download everything else

once you've installed that you need to install [expo](https://expo.dev/). open your terminal or command prompt and run

`npm install -g expo-cli`

next you need to clone this repo so you have a copy on your computer.
then cd to wherever you cloned and run

`npm install`

after that, run

`npm run start`

and it should open a page in your browser. remember to leave the terminal open too.

after that, download the Expo app on your phone. you can just search Google Play or App Store.
scan the qr code, and you should see the app.
